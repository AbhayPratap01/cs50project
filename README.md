A Python command-line tool to organize files in any folder by typeâ€”images, documents, audio, video, and more.

# How to Use
1.Clone this repo or download the files.

2.Install pytest (for running tests):
    pip install pytest

3.Run the organizer:
    python project.py

# How to Run Unit Tests
From the project directory, run:
    pytest test_project.py
-Features
    Automatically sorts files in a folder by their extension/type.
    Avoids overwriting files with the same name (adds suffix).

    Ignores subfolders (MVP); does not require extra packages.

    text
    photo.jpg
    resume.pdf
    song.mp3
